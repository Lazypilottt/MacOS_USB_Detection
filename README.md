# 🔌 USB Detection App for macOS

A macOS SwiftUI application that detects USB devices in real time using IOKit, displaying detailed information such as name, vendor ID, product ID, serial number, and BSD path.

## 📸 Preview

> A simple SwiftUI interface lists connected USB devices as soon as they are plugged in or removed.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time USB device detection
- 🧠 Uses `IOKit` under the hood (via `USBWatcher`)
- 🧼 Clean SwiftUI interface
- 🖥 Device metadata displayed:
  - Product Name
  - Vendor ID
  - Product ID
  - Serial Number (if available)
  - BSD Path (if available)

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- macOS 12 or later
- Xcode 13+
- Swift 5.5+
- `IOKit` framework

---

## 📁 Project Structure

MacOS_USB_Detection/
  - USBWatcher.swift #Listens to USB add/remove events using IOKit
  - USBDevice.swift #Data model for USB devices
  - io_object_t+Extension.swift #Extension for extracting info from io_object_t
  - ContentView.swift #SwiftUI view to list devices
  - USB_DETECTION_APP_V1App.swift #App entry point

---

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

- `USBWatcher` uses `IOServiceAddMatchingNotification` to listen for:
  - `kIOFirstMatchNotification` (device connected)
  - `kIOTerminatedNotification` (device removed)
- Connected devices are parsed using `IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperties`
- The UI automatically reflects changes via `@StateObject` in `ContentView`

## 🔧 Setup & Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MacOS_USB_Detection.git
   cd MacOS_USB_Detection
2. Open the .xcodeproj or .xcodeworkspace in Xcode.
   
3. Build and run the app on your Mac (real devices only; won't work in iOS or simulators).
*(Make sure you enable access to USB devices if prompted in System Preferences > Security & Privacy.)*
